# 💰 Expense Tracker - Node.js & Express  

This project is a **simple Expense Tracker** built with **Node.js, Express.js, and EJS**. It allows users to **track their income and expenses** dynamically, updating the total available balance. It follows a **RESTful API approach** with concepts similar to **threads**, handling data in an **in-memory array instead of a database**.  

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ **Track Income & Expenses**  
- ✅ **Real-time Balance Updates**  
- ✅ **CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)**  
- ✅ **Express.js & EJS for Dynamic Views**  
- ✅ **Uses method-override for PATCH & DELETE requests**  
- ✅ **No Database - Stores Data in an Array**  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Node.js**  
- **Express.js**  
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)**  
- **UUID for Unique IDs**  
- **Method-Override for HTTP Methods**
